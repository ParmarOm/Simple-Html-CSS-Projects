                    <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                    <p> <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>was born on
                        15
                        October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
                        centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the
                        Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.
                        His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and
                        imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
                        housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that
                        took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram
                        and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15]

                        Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister
                        in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been
                        wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous
                        properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a
                        Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri
                        Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local
                        women. The family business had involved trading
                        groceries between the mainland and the island and to and
                        from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the
                        mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban
                        Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses
                        failed and the family fortune and properties were lost
                        by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family
                        was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a
                        young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the
                        family's meager income. [19][20][21]</p>
